This is a Chess game, that has an UCI compatible engine made by myself.

Engine features:
Negamax with alpha-beta pruning.
TT(no hash limit, for the moment).
UCI.

Requirements:
OpenGL 4.0 (or higher).
A way to execute an .exe (Windows, Wine...).

Help:
Run program(TODO: make it runnable) and press on the "pertinax" box, now you have the rendered window and the terminal one.
On terminal type 'help' for help.
